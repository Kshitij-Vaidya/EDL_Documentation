# PCB Directory

This directory is named for convention but **does not contain any PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design files**, as our project does not utilize traditional PCBs.

Instead, we have developed:
- An **in-house Power Distribution Board (PDB)** tailored specifically for our droneâ€™s power routing needs.
- A **custom Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC)** to efficiently provide regulated voltage to onboard components.

All power management is handled through these custom solutions, allowing for greater flexibility and simplified integration with our drone architecture.
