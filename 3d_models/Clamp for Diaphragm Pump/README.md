## Clamp for Diaphragm Pump

### Placement
This is an L-shaped clamp designed with one face mounted to the bottom plate of the drone, while the other face secures the diaphragm pump in an upright position.

### Function
The clampâ€™s sole function is to provide firm and stable support for the diaphragm pump, ensuring it remains upright during operation.  
To withstand mechanical stress and potential impact, the clamp is printed with **100% infill**. This structural density is critical, as previous iterations with lower infill failed under impact conditions.

### Material
Manufactured from **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)** for its high strength, durability, and impact resistance.
