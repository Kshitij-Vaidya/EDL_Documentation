## Canopy

### Placement
The canopy is mounted directly above the top plate of the drone and is secured using adhesive(double-sided) tape applied to the top plate.

### Function
- **Protection:** It safeguards the upper components of the drone from physical impact, dust, and water ingress.
- **Aerodynamics:** It contributes to improved aerodynamic performance by streamlining the top surface of the drone.

### Material
Constructed from **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)**, a durable and impact-resistant thermoplastic ideal for lightweight protective applications.
