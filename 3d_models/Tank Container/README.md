## Tank Container

### Placement
The tank container is affixed to the bottom rim of the tank cover using adhesive. A hole is drilled at the base of the container to accommodate an extrusion, which connects to the pipe leading to the diaphragm pump.

### Function
This component functions as the **primary water storage unit** for the drone. Its dimensions are constrained by:
- **Payload capacity** of the drone
- **Ground clearance** to ensure safe landing and operation

### Material
Fabricated from **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)** for its strength and moldability.  
A **conformal coating spray** is applied to the interior surface to ensure the container is both **water-proof** and **water-tight**.
