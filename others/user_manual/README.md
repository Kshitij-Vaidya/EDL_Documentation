# User Manual

The User Manual contains:  
1. The comprehensive set of instructions needed to power up the drone, its complete start up sequence (Which was finalised after a lot of painstaking trial and error)
2. The various Flight Modes that can be used to operate the drone - Manual and Position
3. The commands used for taking the drone off using the QGC. This is especially useful for autonomous takeoff
