# Others

This is a directory that includes some additional information about our project. We also include a User Manual that contains vital information about operating our drone. We strongly encourage going through the Manual to operate our drone safely and in the proper intended manner.

This directory also has a subdirectory `simulation` which includes some discussions about our simulation results. We used Gazebo to simulate our drone and study its response to the application of an external force. This was done to understand the ability of the drone and the flight controller to handle the recoil caused by the water spraying mechanism.
